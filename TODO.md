* Do we wanna keep using emotion? And if we do, do we wanna use the styled function from
  react-emotion?
* How do developers want to specify which tags to show on a map (if any)?
* Implement pan and zoom
* Package some SVG assets directly with Webpack rather than using the `/assets/tag.svg` URL which
  obviously won't necessarily exist on a customer site
* Is there a better way we can use Webpack Bundle Analyzer so it doesn't hold up the rest of the
  build waiting for us to hit Control-C
